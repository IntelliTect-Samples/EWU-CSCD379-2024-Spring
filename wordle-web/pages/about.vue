            This class project is about exploring more of Vue and Vuetify 
            features and styling our wordle website more! We are adding more pages 
            and creating more features for users on the website, while also creating more features with 
            our game, like word lists and keyboard on the UI. Meg is amazing and someone I look 
            up to, as a women in CS! She does a great job explaing things in class, and I don't 
            know what I would do without her! #MEGFORPRESIDENT
