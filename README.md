1. Once upon a time, there was a hurdle, the Wordle hurdle. It was a devious hurdle, one that ___always___ wanted words. Every day it would eat millions of words, and it still wanted more. The only way to defeat it was to figure out what words it was asking for.
2. The words that our Wordle app requires are the keys to a puzzle... a puzzle freeing the world from the eternal grasp of spelling errors. If we're able to find the correct words, everyone's spelling will be perfect, FOREVER!!!!!
3. We could implement a treasure hunt with the wordle words. Like use it to string us along a path to something. It could be a game: figure out a word to get to the castle, figure out a word to unlock the dragon from the dungeon, figure out a word to learn to fly the dragon, etc. The word could be related to the action you're trying to do (the user would know that).
