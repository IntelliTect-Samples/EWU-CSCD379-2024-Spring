Azure URL:  https://brave-rock-03632d41e.5.azurestaticapps.net/

**Game Description:**

This game is not software developers. It gives you a joke riddle when you give in the correct input. It is only to make you laugh and I have not seen a developer laugh ever. 

Have A Great Day!! 

Keep Laughing Keep Smiling!!
